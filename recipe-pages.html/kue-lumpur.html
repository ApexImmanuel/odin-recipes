      <h3>About Kue Lumpur</h3>
      <p class="description">One of the many traditional Indonesian desserts, Kue Lumpur, which literally translates to “mud cake”, is typically made of potatoes, flour, eggs and coconut milk. Inspired by the Portuguese custard tart, Pasteis de Nata, this treat is sweet and has a soft and creamy texture. With this Kue Lumpur Tape recipe, the potatoes are replaced with fermented cassava, or tape, for an extra tangy flavor. Remember to prepare raisins as no Kue Lumpur is complete without this iconic topping! Enjoy this treat on a relaxing afternoon with a warm cup of tea.</p>

      <p>1 Make the cake better</p>
      <ul class="item-list">
        <li>Tie the pandan leaves together in a knot, this will make them easier to remove later.</li>
        <li>In a pot, add the water, coconut milk and the knot of pandan leaves. Cook on medium heat until it boils. Then filter the coconut milk and let it stand until it warms up. </li>
        <li>Prepare a medium sized mixing bowl, add eggs, sugar, butter and sweetened condensed milk,</li>
        <li>With a hand blender or food processor on high speed, mix until the sugar and butter has dissolved, or about 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and tape to the mixing bowl. Using a spatula, mix until well blended. </li>
        <li>Next, add the coconut milk liquid a little at a time, stirring to make sure it is mixed well. Set aside.</li>

      <p>2 Bake the cake</p>
      <ul class="item-list">
        <li>Preheat the mud cake mold on the stove or oven until it's really hot, or about 10 - 15 mins. if you are using an oven, preheat the oven at 170°C. If you are using a stove, use medium heat.</li>
        <li>After the mold is hot, grease with butter so that the cake does not stick to the mold.</li>
        <li>Then pour enough of the cake batter so each mold is about ¾ full. Place the mold into the oven for about 10 - 15 mins. </li>
        <li>After 10 - 15 mins the dough is half cooked. Add 1 - 2 raisins to the center of each mud cake, and bake for another 10 - 15 mins.</li>
