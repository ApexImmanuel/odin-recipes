      <p class="martext"><i>Roti bakar is a classic Indonesian light breakfast food, as well as a tea-time snack in Malaysia. It is prepared as a sandwich of toasted white bread with a filling, such as chocolate, banana, or cheese. People in Indonesia take chocolate sprinkles seriously; hence, you will see lots of different types and shapes.</i> </p>
