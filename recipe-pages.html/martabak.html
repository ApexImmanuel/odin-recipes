      <p class="martext-">Martabak Manis
        It is the Indonesian version of sweet and thick pancakes with a variety of fillings.
        The most sought-after one is the one with chocolate and peanuts filling. 
        It has a fluffy and chewy texture with a rich buttery and sweet flavour. 
        This sweet street food was introduced by the Arab traders and is very popular in the Arab peninsula and South-East Asian countries such as Yemeni, Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand, etc.
        The food is called Murtabak – from the word Mutabbaq, which means folding. Interestingly, in Malaysia it is called Apam Balik, Apam Pinang, or Apong.
        Whilst in Singapore it is called peanut pancakes or Min Jiang Kueh. Whatever word you use to call it, I can assure you that this thick squishy buttery sweet pancake is one street food you would like to try. 
        It’s just deliciously moreish.

      <p class="description">Key Ingredients</p>
      <p class="martext">Just like other types of pancakes, to make Martabak you need flour, eggs, and raising agents. Instead of using milk, you only need water to mix and emulsify everything.</p>
      <p class="martext">But you need a little bit of tapioca flour to give elasticity and chewiness to the pancake.</p>
      <div class="topping">
        <p class="description">The toppings variety </p>

        <p class="martext">However, you can put all sorts of filling varieties for Martabak Manis.</p>

        <p class="description">Instructions</p>
        <ol class="flavour">
          <li>In a mixing bowl, put the plain flour, sugar and tapioca flour. Stir well until all combined.</li>
          <li>Make a well in the centre of the flour, then put the eggs, vanilla extract and water in. Using a whisk, a handheld mixer, a handheld blender, or a stand mixer, beat and mix the mixture until smooth. Then using a big spoon, keep stirring and beat the butter mixture. Press it against the bowl as you mix. Keep mixing for about 7-10 minutes until the mixture is smooth, sticky and slightly gooey. Set aside and leave it to rest in a warm temperature area for about 1-2 hours.</li>
          <li>When your Martabak batter is ready to cook, divide it into equal three parts.</li>
          <li>Get your 18 cm dia heavy bottom frying pan ready. And heat it up at moderate-high heat. Test with a drop of water on the pan. If the water evaporates quickly, it means your pan is ready.</li>
          <li>Whilst your pan is heating up, put ¼ tsp of baking powder and ¼ tsp of baking soda in a little bowl. Then mix in one tablespoon of water. Stir until all the raising agents dissolve. And then quickly pour in one of the batter mixtures as you stir and mix using a big spoon. Make sure all the liquid blends with the batter.</li>
          <li>Carefully pour the mixture on the hot pan and gently twirl and rotate the pan so that the mixture will cover at least half of the height of the pan’s edges. Then let it cook at moderate-low to moderately high heat. You also want to keep moving the pan to ensure the heat distribution is even on every part of the pan.</li>
          <li>When the pancake’s surface is covered with bubbles, and the pancake is half cooked, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar on it. Then put the lid on the pan and leave it to cook at low heat. Again, you may want to keep rotating the pan to make sure the heat evenly spreads.</li>
          <li>Once the Martabak is cooked, tease the edges with a spatula and take the Martabak off the pan. Put it on a chopping board, then spread some butter on the pancake and drizzle the condensed milk over it. Sprinkle your preferred toppings. I use chopped peanuts and chopped milk chocolate.</li>
          <li>Afterwards, cut the pancake at the middle and fold it over into half. Spread some more butter, this time on both sides of the folded pancake. Finally, cut your Martabak into small pieces. I make about 5-6 pieces for an 18 cm dia size of Martabak.</li>
          <li>Continue to cook the rest of the batter following step 5-9.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="description">Notes</p>
        <ul class="flavour">
          <li>Working on mixing and stirring the batter is crucial. Make sure you spend at least 5 minutes after you whisk the ingredients into a smooth mixture.</li>
          <li>Make sure you let the batter rest in a warm temperature. If you have a light bulb in your oven, you can leave the batter to rest in it, with the bulb on. If not, you can turn the oven on for about 5 minutes at gas 3, then switch it off. Then put the mixing bowl in the oven with the door left slightly ajar.</li>
          <li>The key to getting your Martabak fluffy with lots of bubbles is the heat distribution. So you will have to keep rotating the pan at the same time you play with the heat level. I turn the heat from low to moderate-high every so often. </li>
          <li>Don’t sprinkle the sugar too early. Make sure you wait until more than ¾ of the pancake surface is filled with bubbles. </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="description">Top tips for making softly squishy Martabak</p>
        <ul class="flavour">
          <li>Once your batter is smooth, you would want to keep working on it by mixing and stirring it using a big spoon. It takes me about 5-7 minutes to do it. But please don’t skip this. Because this helps the batter to develop gluten better that it will work nicely with the raising agent. So your Martabak will have hundreds of bubbles, and it will have a fluffy yet elastically soft and chewy texture. </li>
          <li>This resting period is needed for the gluten to develop. So don’t miss this out.</li>
          <li>Ideally, you use a heavy bottom pan. But you can use your non-stick pan like mine too. Just make sure you don’t overheat the pan before cooking and keep turning the heat up and down as you cook your pancake. </li>
          <li>Keep moving and rotating your pan around the heat as you turn the heat higher and lower. The reason is you want to make sure the pan is not overheated and has enough heat for the raising agents in the batter to react. Never leave the pancake unattended. Otherwise, your pancake won’t rise evenly high, and it won’t be evenly cooked.</li>
        </ul>
